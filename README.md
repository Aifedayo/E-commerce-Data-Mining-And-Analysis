# E-commerce-Product-Scraping-And-Analysis

## Description

This project aims to scrape product data from various e-commerce websites using BeautifulSoup, perform data analysis and manipulation with Pandas, and visualize the findings using Matplotlib. Additionally, Scikit-learn will be employed to build predictive models based on the scraped data, providing insights into product trends and customer preferences.

## Features

- **Data Scraping**: Extract product details such as titles, prices, ratings, and reviews from e-commerce websites.
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize Pandas to clean and preprocess the data, enabling comprehensive analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create informative visualizations with Matplotlib to present findings clearly and effectively.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use Scikit-learn to develop machine learning models for predictions and insights based on historical data.

## Installation

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
